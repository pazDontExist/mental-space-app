**You should use the Discussion TAB, but...whatever**

**Is your feature request related to a problem? Please describe.**
Ah, the rollercoaster of emotions that is life!

**Describe the solution you'd like**
In a magical land where push notifications bring joy instead of anxiety, here's the dream feature: I want an app that can read my mind (because, why not?) and dispense virtual hugs or motivational memes accordingly. Bonus points if it can predict breakdowns and preemptively suggest soothing playlists.

**Describe alternatives you've considered**
Because sanity is overrated, let's explore some alternatives:
1. Create an Ionic plugin that transforms intrusive thought in positive thoughts
2. Implement somehow something that as soon as it sense distress will show me the nearest chocolate store (or beer place)
3. Hire an Angular psychic â€“ someone who can predict my mental state based on my app navigation patterns. It's like UX design but for the soul.

**Additional context**
In the grand circus of my mobile app-induced mental gymnastics, let me sprinkle some context: ** insert your additional context here **
