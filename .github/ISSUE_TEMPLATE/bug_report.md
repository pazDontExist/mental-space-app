Oh joy, a bug in the mental health app – because who doesn't want their emotions to be as unpredictable as software bugs? So, here's the scoop: -- INSERT DETAIL HERE --

**To Reproduce**
Brace yourself for a rollercoaster of emotions as you follow these riveting steps:
1. Stumble into the app like you're navigating a foggy emotional maze.
2. Execute a tap on '....' with the finesse of a frustrated tap dancer.
3. Embark on a poetic scroll down to '....' and voila! Witness the bug doing its interpretative dance of errors.

**Device and App Info (please complete the following information):**
 - Device: [e.g. My beloved emotional support smartphone/potato is Apple/Samsung/Whatever. and put model too]
 - OS: [e.g. Android 10 – because bugs are ageless / iOS 10]
 - App Version: [e.g. 1.0.0 – because it's the first of many emotional rollercoasters]

**Additional context**
As if dealing with human emotions wasn't enough, let me sprinkle some context on this emotional rollercoaster: imagine a perplexed developer, fueled by the existential dread of debugging feelings, attempting to bring order to this chaotic dance of code and emotions. Feel the struggle, embrace the chaos, and maybe share a virtual hug with the poor soul attempting to debug the very fabric of human experience.
