# CONTRIBUTING

Read the [CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md](https://github.com/pazDontExist/mental-space-app/blob/master/CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md) FILE !!!!

Oh, splendid. Another brave soul ready to dive into the chaos of my Ionic, Angular, and Capacitor-powered mobile app. 
Before you get lost in this vortex of frustration, here are some guidelines to make sure you don't end up pulling your hair out:

## Getting Started (because why not?)

1. **Install the Usual Suspects**: Ionic, Angular, and Capacitor. If your patience hasn't run out yet, proceed.

2. **Clone the Repository**: Fork it if you dare. Clone it to your realm of despair.

## Contribute Like You Mean It (or Don't)

- **Feature Requests**: Got a brilliant idea? Raise an issue or use the Discussion Tab. If i like it, i might consider it. (the totalitarianism will end as soon as there'll be enough users interested in this)

- **Bug Reports**: Found a bug? Surprise, surprise. Report it, and if you're feeling particularly annoyed, fix it.

- **Coding Style**: Follow the coding guidelines; we have enough chaos in the code already.

- **Documentation**: Improve it if you must. Frankly, who reads documentation anyway?

- **Testing**: Write tests like you're trying to convince a stubborn cat to take a bath â€“ with great difficulty.

## Pull Request Rituals (more like annoyances)

1. **Branch Naming**: Choose a name; i don't care. But if you have to...be smart and use a name that make sense.

2. **Commit Messages**: Oh Boy...Check [HERE](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/en/v1.0.0/), please.

3. **Testing Torture**: Run tests if you feel like it. Kidding. DO THEM.

4. **CI/CD Circus**: As soon as i have time i will implement it

May your contributions be as irritating as a mosquito buzzing in my ears! ðŸ¦ŸðŸ¤¬
