# Mental Space
This is a very important matter to me. I know how a mental illness can impact an individual and all those around him/her.

So i decided to start my project "Mental Space" where it aim to help the user to have a better understanding of it's situation but most of all to create a system that would help it's professional helper (Psychiatrist and/or Psychologist) to do better their job.

This app, that initially i started as private thing, is now Public with a creative common license and i truly hope to find some good contributors in order to make this project BETTER.

The back-end part is reachable [HERE](https://github.com/pazDontExist/mental-space-backend)

# Things you should know
- The use of a creative common license is not casual. My "vision" (if you want to call it so) is to give the opportunity to the user to have an instrument totally COST-FREE. But i live in the real world and i know that those stuff have a cost. That's why, on the backend, i've implemented a solution for "Subscribing" doctor behind a modest payment (they can afford it and is very cheap...unless you change prices)
- The App (on it's basics) works. And still have a lot of improvements and bug fixes to do. But hey...at least the main part are working.
- Since i used this on a personal level (and not shared with anyone else) on the Security standpoint you might find something not properly good (or not in line with the actual security standard). Please, be kind. And just help solve those issues
- I currently work a lot (my last commit before re-opening this repo was 8 months ago). But i finally managed to find a window to dedicate to this.
- Most of the things are in italian language (labels mostly). Planning to use i18n format asap.
